# Week 4 Course Project: Getting &amp; Cleaning Data

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate an ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set, based [a study](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) from the emerging world of wearable computing.

The project assumes that the contents of a [source dataset](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) has been unzipped into a data directory *(./Data/)* in the root of the working R directory.

The project consists of - 

1. An RScript ([run_analysis.R](https://github.com/nikiwiles/cleaningdataproject/blob/master/run_analysis.R)) that imports, merges, cleans, summarises  the source dataset
2. The target dataset ([summaryMeans.tsv](https://github.com/nikiwiles/cleaningdataproject/blob/master/summaryMeans.tsv)) 
3. A file ([features.tsv](https://github.com/nikiwiles/cleaningdataproject/blob/master/features.tsv)) that provides column names and indexes for the target dataset)
4. A codebook ([CodeBook.md](https://github.com/nikiwiles/cleaningdataproject/blob/master/CodeBook.md)) that provides further context and describes  the target dataset and the process used to generate it.
